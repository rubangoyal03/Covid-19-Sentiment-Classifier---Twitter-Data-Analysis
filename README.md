# Covid-19-Sentiment-Classifier---Twitter-Data-Analysis


Introduction
Through this notebook, we compared the ability of numerous models in the classification of Covid 19 tweets into three independent classes, namely Positive, Negative and Neutral. The dataset used for this task can be found at COVIDSenti, which we will discuss more in the Exploratory data analysis section of the notebook code. In particular, we developed a bi-directional LSTM, a bi-directional GRU, a self-trained transformer, and a pre-trained BERT model. Ultimately, we compare the performance of our models against those of the recommended paper(link in notebook) given in the project outline using the pre-trained BERT model as a strong baseline to compare against. In the future, this will help stakeholders comprehend social reactions and come up with better communication strategies for public health crises.
